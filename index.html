  <p>I am training as a Software Developer, Data Analyst and Machine Learning Engineer.  I am currently enrolled in the Software Technology program at Ogden-Weber Technical College.  I am also acquiring certifications as an ML Engineer and Algorithmic Trader from Udacity.   I have a Masters in Data Analytics, an MBA and an MS in Instructional Design.  I have working knowledge of C#, R, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java and Python programming languages.

    I have a multi-displinary background including military intelligence, psychology, linguistics, economics, virtual reality and educational technology.  I have worked abroad for ten years with military, universities and vocational schools.   I have working knowledge of Arabic, Chinese and French.  I am very mobile, able to relocate quickly, adapt easily to diverse working conditions and have a current passport.
